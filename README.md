# Service Map - Ukraine

![image](/ui/public/icons/default_icon.png)

This is a personal project to manage and access various services (links) in a structured and authenticated way.

The project includes an Express backend and a frontend Vue frontend.

### Setup Authentication
- This project uses [TOTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_one-time_password) for Authentication (those 6 digits code generated by Google Authenticator)
- You can use [this TOPT Generator](https://github.com/CoinBR/totp_generator) to generate:
  - The secrety key, which you will paste on `services.yml`.
  - The QR code, so you can scan it in Google Authenticator and keep generating 6 digits codes on your phone.


### Setup Project

- Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder.
- run in the terminal:
  - `git submodule update --init --recursive --remote`
  - `./run.sh setup`
- Edit the generated `.env` and `services.yml` files according to your needs


### Run in Development Mode

```Sh
./run.sh dev
```

This will start both the API and UI in development mode.

### Production Mode

Make sure you have Docker and Docker-Compose installed

```Sh
./run.sh prod
```

This will use docker-compose to build and run everything.

#### Why the Name "Ukraine"?

The name "Ukraine" for this project holds a personal significance. During the unfortunate and ongoing conflict in Ukraine, many YouTubers and news outlets have frequently used maps to cover and explain the situation. This constant exposure to maps in the context of Ukraine has led me to associate the image of a map with the country itself.

Given that this project is essentially a "Services Map," I found it fitting to name it "Service Map - Ukraine" as a nod to this association. While the war is a tragic event, this naming is a way to reflect the connection I made between maps and Ukraine during this time.

#### Notes
- This project is mainly for personal use and customized for my own needs.
- Uses environment variables for configuration.
- Services and authentication details are managed in services.yml.

#### Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, TypeScript
- **Frontend**: Vue 3, Vite
- **Authentication**: TOTP-based authentication using speakeasy
- **Configuration**: Docker, .env files, yml files
